  <!-- Why Fashion Matters -->
  <h2>Why Fashion Matters</h2>
  <p>
    A global survey by Harvard University (2009–2011) revealed that the fashion industry was worth <strong>2.3 trillion USD</strong>. Within six years (by 2017–18), it surged to <strong>18.2 trillion USD</strong>, reflecting fashion’s massive impact on global economy. Fashion is not just aesthetic — it's a livelihood, a personality enhancer, and a self-expression tool. In countries like India, fashion drives small businesses, artisans, tailors, influencers, and local markets. Fashion empowers individuality and drives confidence in both urban and rural populations alike.

  <!-- Key Fashion Insights -->
  <h2>Key Fashion Insights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Fashion begins at birth:</strong> From the moment a baby is wrapped in cloth, fashion silently becomes part of human life. It evolves with age, status, culture, and profession — proving it is not a luxury but a lifelong presence.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fashion is a basic need:</strong> In today’s world, wearing appropriate and stylish clothing isn't only about appearance, it's tied to self-respect, professional presentation, and cultural identity. It shapes first impressions in jobs, interviews, and society.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fashion grows every day:</strong> From trending colors to shifting cuts, fashion is a dynamic art. The rapid rise of social media, e-commerce, and influencers proves how quickly styles adapt and influence people daily.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fashion never dies:</strong> Trends may fade, but fashion always comes back in cycles — whether it’s bell bottoms from the 70s or vintage kurtas. It renews itself through creativity, making it a sustainable industry.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fashion is reusable:</strong> With proper care, clothes can be passed down, upcycled, or styled differently. Realynn Rise promotes garments that last longer, reducing environmental waste and supporting slow fashion.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fashion reflects confidence:</strong> What we wear directly affects how we feel. A good outfit can uplift our mood, boost self-esteem, and encourage participation in social and professional spaces.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fashion generates employment:</strong> From fabric suppliers to fashion designers, tailors to delivery partners — the fashion industry supports millions of jobs. It is one of the most inclusive industries offering low-entry to high-skill opportunities.
